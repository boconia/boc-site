# Chapter 7: Civic Trust Loan

We donâ€™t believe in credit scores. We donâ€™t believe in KYC forms.

We believe in something far older, and far more powerful: trust.

**Civic Trust Loan is not charity. Itâ€™s not an airdrop.**  
Itâ€™s a decentralized lending experiment based on behavior, restraint, and integrity.

If civilization means anything, itâ€™s whether people still choose to do the right thing â€” even when they donâ€™t have to.

## ðŸ’  What It Is

Civic Trust Loan lets anyone, anywhere, request a small BOC loan based solely on their on-chain behavior and a symbolic pledge of trust.  
No forms. No gatekeepers. Just a shared belief that maybe, just maybe, we still deserve a system that believes in us.

## ðŸ“œ Eligibility & Loan Terms

- No identity required â€” only a wallet and an application.
- 90-day cooldown between requests.
- One-time symbolic deposit to discourage spam and abuse.
- Minimum BOC holdings of $1 equivalent required to qualify.
- Loan amount: 35â€“1,000 USDC equivalent in BOC, assigned dynamically.
- 1-year repayment window, with 1â€“12% interest based on automated credit tiering.
- Exceptionally vulnerable cases may apply for 0% interest.

## ðŸ§­ Trust Over Time

- Repayment earns on-chain reputation and access to future higher loan amounts.
- Consistent repayment unlocks new levels of trust (automated credit tiers).
- Missed repayments wonâ€™t punish you â€” but your trust score wonâ€™t grow.

---

## ðŸ›  Governance & Evolution

- Civic Trust Loan will gradually transition to DAO-managed governance.
- Community will help shape loan caps, risk filters, and symbolic deposit rules.
- In time, verified borrowers with clean repayment records may join peer review.

---

## ðŸ§± Execution & Safety

- Initial claims will be reviewed semi-manually with on-chain automation in development.
- Funds will be held in a dedicated loan treasury wallet, publicly auditable.
- All loan applications and outcomes will be publicly recorded.

## ðŸ”¥ Why We Do This

Because there are still people who fall, not from failure, but from the world turning its back on them.  
Because not everyone needs saving â€” some just need a start.  
Because sometimes, the smallest amount of dignity is worth more than a thousand slogans.

**This is not a loan platform.**  
**It is a test of civilization.**
